Simple C program: We will implement a guessing game in C language.
 
Here is how we play this game:
 
Think of a number between 1 and 100 in your mind. Then, your program should ask you minimal # of questions and determine your number based on your answers. Program's question format will be
Is it NN (<, =, >)?
You can respond to that question in 3 ways: < indicates that your number is less than computer's guess, = means that program guessed your number right, and > means that your number  is greater than computer's guess.
Allow the user to play this game any number of times.
When the user is ready to quit, output average # of guesses / game.
Implementation guidelines:
Use a separate function to play the game.
Invoke that function from main() repeatedly as needed.
